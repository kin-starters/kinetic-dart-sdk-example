# Kinetic Dart SDK Starter App

This is a starter app for the [Kinetic Dart SDK](https://github.com/kin-labs/kinetic-dart). 

It is a simple app that allows you to create keypairs, create an account, transfer Kin, and view your balance and account history.

It uses the [Dart library for Solana](https://pub.dev/packages/solana) built by the [Crypto Please](https://cryptoplease.com/) team.

## Usage

In order to use this SDK, please head over to the [Kinetic Dart SDK](https://kinetic.kin.org/docs/sdk/dart) documentation.

## Version

This SDK is built to work with `@kinetic/api@v1.0.0-rc.1`. Using it with other versions may lead to issues.
